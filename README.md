# CelestialDance
An app that simulates movement of stars and planets  
Back-end made in Spring boot, frond-end in JavaScript.  
# Details  
This app is using Solar system OpenData API (https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/) to gain data about celestial bodies in our solar system.  
My REST API sets bodies on two-dimensional map, and simulates their movement acording to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and Newton's law of universal gravitation.  
# Deployment  
You can test app on surge: http://celestial-dance.surge.sh/  
You can also connect directly to my REST API, deployed on AWS with ip: 3.66.21.51 (for ex. http://3.66.21.51:8080/get-one?name=Sun)
# How to use  
To generate body and add it to the simulation pick the name from upper list [1.]. It shoud move to bottom list [2.] and a body shoud appear on the map. If you don't see any body just click on name on list [2.] and choose "Focus at body" on window that just pop up.

In order to simulate movement, you need at least two bodies with enabled simulation (green â˜ˆ window button). To set movement consistent with our solar system you need a secondary and a gravitational primary body (Sun for planet simulation, or planet for moon simulation). When you generate right objects pop up window of secondary body and click on ðŸ”† button, to set primary body, â˜‰ button to set object in right position and velocity on map, and â˜ˆ button to enable it for simulation.
