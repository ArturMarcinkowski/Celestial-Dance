# CelestialDance
An app that simulates movement of stars and planets  
Back-end made in Spring boot, frond-end in JavaScript.  
# Details  
This app is using Solar system OpenData API (https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/) to gain data about celestial bodies in our solar system.  
My REST API sets bodies on two-dimensional map, and simulates their movement acording to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and Newton's law of universal gravitation.  
# Deployment  
You can test app on surge: http://celestial-dance.surge.sh/  
You can also connect directly to my REST API, deployed on AWS with ip: 3.66.21.51 (for ex. http://3.66.21.51:8080/get-one?name=Sun)
